FlappyBird-HTML5
================

A FlappyBird remake using the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.  Play it [here](http://ninemind.github.io/FlappyBird-HTML5). 

Notice
=====
The visual assets for this game have been extracted from the original game and modified by me for performance.  There is no intention to steal Dong Nguyen's (the original creators) work. This was only an experiment to get myself and others familiarized with the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.

Credits
=====
* Dong Nguyen for creating the original game.
* Pascal Rettig for creating the Quintus HTMl5 gaming engine as well as answering my questions on the community page.
